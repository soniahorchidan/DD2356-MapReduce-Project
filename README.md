# DD2356-MapReduce-Project
The final project of the DD2356 Methods in High Performance Computing at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

The goal of the project was to implement a <b>MapReduce</b> framework in a high performance context and apply it on a specific use-case: <b>WordCount</b>. 

The design includes <b>MPI</b> non-blocking  point-to-point  communication  and  collective  MPI I/O.  We  also  explored  methods  to  parallelize  the  tasks  even further, at each processâ€™ level, by integrating <b>OpenMP</b>.

To compile this code on Beskow, simply change the default compiler to <b>GNU</b> and use the provided Makefile.
